# FIGHTBOAT
Only the fittest fightiest boats may win

EC327 Intro to Software Engineering project
A different take on the classic Battleship game

Roles (loosely based):
- Lead: Sean N.
- GUI: Terry
- Interface: Sean B.
- Processing: Ye
- Documentation: Cullen

Basic Functions from original Battleship Game:
- Place boats on a grid
- Grid is typically 10 by 10 units 
- Each player has his own grid. 
- Various ships, certain ships are longer than others. Length of ship corresponds to one grid coordinate. 

SHIPS:
- Carrier [5 units]
- Battleship [4 units]
- Cruiser [3 units]
- Submarine [3 units] 
- Destroyer [2 units]
- Each turn = one player specifies a grid spot to attack on the other players grid. If that grid spot includes a segment of a ship, a X is revealed in that spot, signifying a portion of some ship has been destroyed.

We will be implementing various improvements/twists upon this basic forumula!
