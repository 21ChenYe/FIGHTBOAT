Ideas for a twist

Every boat has different abilities, for example:

Carrier [5] = sends an aircraft fleet that bombs 2 spaces each spaced one space apart. Reveals if there are any targetable ships
within one block of both bombing spots. (cooldown: 10+? turns)
Battleship [4] = grants ability to attack in a plus sign (5 space total) (cooldown: 10+? turns)
Cruiser [3] = repair one damaged component (cannot revive dead ships)
Submarine [3]	= Does not have to be reported as sank unless there are no more units on the field
Destroyer [2] = can reposition itself within 4 spaces [cooldown: 5 turns]
Supply Ship [2] = can swap positions with one ship. [cooldown 10 turns] 

The classic battleship game has ship values of 5 - 4 - 3 - 3 - 2 in terms of space taken.
This means that overall, 17 spots out of 100 are taken up by boats.

One twist we can implement:
- You don't have to use exactly that formation of carrier - battleship - cruiser - submarine - destroyer. 
- You can use ANY formation whose total space taken adds up to 17.
Wanna use 7 destroyers and a submarine? Go for it. 
Wanna do 5 carriers and a destroyer? Go for it.
Wanna have 5 submarines? DO IT.
